# United States Mantal Health Analysis

The aim of this project was to get a better understanding of what the drivers of poor mental health are in the US. The dataset used was from a [2019 US County Health Ranking census](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation). An array of regression techniques were used to explore how mental health related to the other features in the dataset. The final model highlighted that teen births, food insecurity and single parent households as the the best predictors of poor mental health.
